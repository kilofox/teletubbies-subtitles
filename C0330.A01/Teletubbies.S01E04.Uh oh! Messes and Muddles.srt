224
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:55,919

One day in Teletubbyland

233
00:45:28,487 --> 00:45:31,285
the Teletubbies were watching
the clouds float by

234
00:45:32,887 --> 00:45:34,764
Clouds float by

235
00:45:38,727 --> 00:45:40,638
A big fluffy one floated by

236
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:46,565
A big fluffy one

237
00:45:52,247 --> 00:45:54,283
A long thin wispy one floated by

238
00:45:58,727 --> 00:46:00,399
Long thin wispy one

239
00:46:05,967 --> 00:46:07,798
