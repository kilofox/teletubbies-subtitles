If you're poorly she makes you better

33
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:45,318
Are you coming with me

34
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:46,283

35
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:48,477
why don't you come and sit down
while l just finish what l'm doing

36
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:51,524
Mummys a doctor.

37
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:59,241
When you're not feeling very wel
l first of all you go and see my mummy

38
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:02,321

40
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:13,920
My mummy uses this torch
to look in your ears and mouth.

41
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:20,286
Do you want me to check for you

42
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,038

if ears are poorly they go very red

00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,798
and then we can give people
some medicine to make them better

48
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:42,805
That one's fine though

49
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:45,839
When children come and

00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:47,918
they're poorly do you know
what else we have to look at

51
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:49,600

52
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:50,916

53
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:53,161

Where's Po? Where's Po?

456
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,803
Laa-Laa could see Po's scooter

457

458
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,733
But where was Po?

459
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:26,168
